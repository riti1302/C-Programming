  Welcome to the cost division
 
  Here are the instructions on how the program works:
  
  The program takes two inputs namely,
  1. Number of person
  2. Number of transactions

  Suppose, we have given input of number of person as 
  3 and number of transactions as 4. It means that 2 persons 
  had done 1 transaction each and 3rd person had done 2
  transactions.

  This program calculates the cost that each person should
  recieve or pay.
